Changes in version 0.1.5
  - Added missing AC_OUTPUT to configure.ac to remove warning on CRAN.
  - Minor changes to documentation (now using \doi{} for references).

Changes in version 0.1.4
  - Updated maintainer's email address.

Changes in version 0.1.3
  - Fixed error occurring when "class(matrix(...))" returns a vector of length 
    two.

Changes in version 0.1.2
  - Patched "configure.ac" file to solve compilation problems on some platforms.
  - Fortran native routines now registered and symbol search disabled.
  - README file added to provide information about installation requirements.
  - Added empty "configure.win" file for Windows users.

Changes in version 0.1.1
  - Added simul.R.prior() and simul.nfac.prior() functions to simulate the prior
    distributions of the number of latent factors, and of the correlation matrix
    of the factors.
  - Improved plot() generic function for "befa" object to show more posterior
    results, such as heatmaps for indicator posterior probabilities, factor
    loadings and correlation matrix of the latent factors.
  - Now using ggplot2 package for nice-looking graphs.
  - Added "configure" script to address cross-compilation problems.
  - Minor improvements to documentation.

Changes in version 0.1.0
  - Fixed dependencies in Fortran code (Makevars file) and added gfortran as
    system requirement in DESCRIPTION file to solve cross-compilation problems.
  - Added print(), summary() and plot() functions to "befa" object.
  - Removed HPPmodel(), as highest posterior probability models can now be
    summarized with generic function summary().
  - Renamed two arguments passed to befa() function for consistency
    (loading.start -> alpha.start, idiovar.start -> sigma.start).
  - Removed deprecated cleanup file.
  - Added NEWS file.

Changes in version 0.0.2
  - First version released on CRAN.
